Adds Dynamic DNS (DDNS) support for the Kea DHCP server.

Manages the kea-dhcp-ddns daemon configuration including TSIG keys,
forward and reverse DNS zones, and per-subnet DDNS policy settings
for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.

Integrates with the core Kea DHCP plugin via the plugins_run() hook
mechanism to inject DDNS parameters into kea-dhcp4.conf and kea-dhcp6.conf.
